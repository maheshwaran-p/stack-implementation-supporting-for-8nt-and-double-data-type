C++ Templates
In this article, you'll learn about templates in C++. You'll learn to use the power of templates for generic programming.

Templates are powerful features of C++ which allows you to write generic programs. In simple terms, you can create a single function or a class to work with different data types using templates.

Templates are often used in larger codebase for the purpose of code reusability and flexibility of the programs.

The concept of templates can be used in two different ways:

Function Templates
Class Templates
Function Templates
A function template works in a similar to a normal function, with one key difference.

A single function template can work with different data types at once but, a single normal function can only work with one set of data types.

Normally, if you need to perform identical operations on two or more types of data, you use function overloading to create two functions with the required function declaration.
